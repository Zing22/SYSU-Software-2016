# CRAFT
Community-based Retro-synthetic Analysis Functional plaTform

## Overview
CRAFT is a integrated software for crafting synthetic biological system from design, validation to share. 
It provides concise and convenient user interface, where you can customize your own synthetic biological system by using specific algorithms to search appropriate circuits and simulate and your validation experiment will be supported with our standard protocols. Your also can share your designs in user community, help others by searching solutions or sharing your computing resources, or upload your experiment data to improve the accuracy of our model.
