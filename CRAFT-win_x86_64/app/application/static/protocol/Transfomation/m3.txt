Thaw a tube of NEB Stable Competent E. coli cells on ice for 10 minutes.
Add 1 -2 l containing 100 pg-100 ng of plasmid DNA to the cell mixture. Carefully flick the tube 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex.
Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes. Do not mix.
Heat shock at exactly 42 for exactly 30 seconds. Do not mix. Place on ice for 5 minutes. Do not mix.
Pipette 950l of room temperature SOC into the mixture and place at 30 for 60 minutes. Shake the tube horizontally at 250 rpm or rotate.
Warm selection plates to 30.
Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tube and inverting. Then spread 50-100 l of cells or diluted cells onto a selection plate. Incubate plates 24 hrs at 30 or overnight at 37.
