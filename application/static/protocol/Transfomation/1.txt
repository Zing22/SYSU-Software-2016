Thaw a tube of NEB Express Competent E. coli cells on ice until the last ice crystals disappear. Mix gently and carefully pipette 50 l of cells into a transformation tube on ice.
Add 1-5 l containing 1 pg-100 ng of plasmid DNA to the cell mixture. Carefully flick the tube 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex.
Place the mixture on ice for 30 minutes. Do not mix.
Heat shock at exactly 42 for exactly 60 seconds. Do not mix
Place on ice for 5 minutes. Do not mix.
Pipette 950 l of room temperature SOC into the mixture.
Place at 37 for 60 minutes. Shake vigorously (250 rpm) or rotate.
Warm selection plates to 37.
Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tube and inverting, then perform several 10-fold serial dilutions in SOC.
Spread 50-100l of each dilution onto a selection plate and incubate overnight at 37. Alternatively, incubate at 30 for 24-36 hours or at 25 for 48 hours.
