Remove cells from -80∼C freezer and thaw in your hand.
Thaw a tube of NEB Stable Competent E. coli cells on ice until the last ice crystals disappear. Mix gently and carefully pipette 50 米l of cells into a transformation tube on ice.
Add 1每2 米l containing 100 pg每100 ng of plasmid DNA to the cell mixture. Carefully flick the tube 4每5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex.
Place the mixture on ice for 2 minutes. Do not mix.
Heat shock at exactly 42∼C for exactly 30 seconds. Do not mix.
Place on ice for 2 minutes. Do not mix.
Pipette 950 米l of room temperature SOC into the mixture. Immediately spread 50每100 米l onto a selection plate and incubate overnight at 30∼C for 24 hours.
