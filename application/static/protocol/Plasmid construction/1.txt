Digest Plasmid Backbone
Add 4 ul linearized plasmid backbone (25ng/ul for 100ng total)
Add 4 ul of Enzyme Master Mix
Digest Part A
Add 4 ul Part A (25ng/ul for 100ng total)
Add 4 ul of Enzyme Master Mix
Digest Part B
Add 4 ul Part B (25ng/ul for 100ng total)
Add 4 ul of Enzyme Master Mix
Digest all three reactions at 37C/30 min, heat kill 80C/20 min
Ligation

Add 2ul of digested Plasmid Backbone (25 ng)
Add equimolar amount of Part A (EcoRI-HF SpeI digested) fragment (< 3 ul)
Add equimolar amount of Part B (XbaI PstI digested fragment) (< 3 ul)
Add 1 ul T4 DNA ligase buffer. Note: Do not use quick ligase
Add 0.5 ul T4 DNA ligase
Add water to 10 ul
Ligate 16C/30 min, heat kill 80C/20 min
Transform with 1-2 ul of product
Note: For linearized plasmid backbones provided by iGEM HQ, a plasmid backbone with an insert of BBa_J04450 was used as template. As a result any red colonies that appear during your ligation may be due to the template as a background. Digesting with Dpn1 before use should reduce this occurrence.
